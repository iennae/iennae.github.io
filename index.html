  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago after a conference, a friend recommended I meet up with <a href="https://twitter.com/mariusducea">Marius Dulcea</a> in the Bay area. We grabbed some coffee and with the discussion I felt energized.</p>

<p>Part of the energy derived from Marius being awesome. Marius has been a key <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/">DevOpsDays Silicon Valley</a> organizer for years and community builder within the Chef and DevOps community. His insight into a variety of current and future technology was interesting and educational.</p>

<p>Part of the energy derived from the mental engagement outside of the everyday. The value of this fellowship was expanding horizons to see beyond the walls of the technology and cultural mores of my then company. My role was in the middle of the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;ladder of prestige&rdquo; leading to a lot of pressure with little reward. I had been having problems seeing the value of the work I was doing or what impact it made.</p>

<p><img src="http://iennae.github.io/assets/ladder_of_prestige_small.jpg" alt="Ladder of Prestige" /></p>

<p>Talking to Marius gave me insight about what I was working on. It helped me recognize that I needed a change and that it was critical for my mental health to connect with a larger community of practicitioners.</p>

<p>All conferences have a informal hallway track that describes the conversations in conference corridors in between sessions and after hours. Conferences are only a few days in length so the relative benefit of the hallway track is minimal. Depending on costs of attendance and job flexibility, the hallway track may not be available to a majority of people in the industry.</p>

<p>I envisioned creating a &ldquo;hallway track&rdquo; space with intra-company cooperation; affording individuals a place to meet together with no agenda, to connect, share in an undirected manner.</p>

<p>I sent out a tweet with a location, time and #coffeeops and showed up. The first few times, only one or two folks would show up. As time passed more people joined and interesting discussions like <a href="https://medium.com/bridging-the-gaps/leveling-up-your-skills-51169238e0d7">leveling up your skills</a> were had. Now, other folks have started up local coffeeops from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Downtown-Seattle-Friday-Morning-CoffeeOps/">Seattle, Washington</a> to Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>As a remote employee at <a href="http://chef.io">Chef</a>, it has become even more valuable to me as water cooler time; that time to take a break and take a breather.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coffeeops.org/">Coffeeops</a> is a way to generate your own hallway track, cross company cooperation and individual improvement.</p>

<p>How do you start up a CoffeeOps?</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes time to catch hold.</li>
<li>Talk about it. Ask for help. Use twitter and mailing lists.</li>
<li>Pick a good environment for talking.</li>
<li>Have coffee and show up. More people will show up over time. (You can also drink tea or cocoa or have brunch!)</li>
<li>Treat the meeting as work. Part of effective working is education and</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I purchased a set of 3 Uniball Jetstream RT 0.7 mm black ink in January of 2014. The first thing I noticed was the length of the pen was significantly shorter from the Safari that I&rsquo;ve been using. It will take some time before I can tell whether this is actually a problem or just a difference.</p>

<p>The ink definitely dries quickly. I can&rsquo;t see how someone could smudge this unless the paper was somewhat wet already.</p>

<p>On moleskin paper, it was more readily stuttering where ink seemed to stop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a supporter of the <a href="http://www.thesparknotebook.com/">spark notebook</a> kickstarter, I&rsquo;m eagerly looking forward to the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; notebook. I find the act of writing notes much more helpful to organizing my thoughts than typing in to a computer most of the time. The challenge is finding the right combination of paper, pen, and ink. When everything is in balance, the flow of thoughts is seamless. There is no thoughts blocked as the pen dribbles, sticks, or stutters across the page. Ink flows in a seamless concert without the fear of smearing as I pause and withdraw inwards to reflect.</p>

<p>When Kate Matsudaira blogged about the search for the <a href="https://popforms.com/notebooks-fall-short/">perfect notebook</a> it resonated with me for many reasons. The deconstruction of the problems of the many notebooks she examined illuminated an important process that I hadn&rsquo;t thought through before especially around keeping track of what works, why, and how it could be better. I don&rsquo;t think there is a &ldquo;one&rdquo; perfect notebook, but I think the <a href="http://www.thesparknotebook.com/">spark notebook</a> is perfect for organization of goals, time keeping and the &ldquo;big&rdquo; ideas in daily work life.</p>

<p>When the spark notebook delivery email came out, I realized that I wanted to know more about the writing utensils people use and prefer to write with. I tweeted out and the twitterverse responded.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>what is the recommended pen to use with my soon to be here perfect notebook :) <a href="https://twitter.com/katemats">@katemats</a></p>&mdash; Jennifer (@sigje) <a href="https://twitter.com/sigje/status/558101746208493568">January 22, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Generally I try pens out and then forget what worked and didn&rsquo;t. So I&rsquo;m going to try out some of the suggestions and share my experiences.</p>

<p><strong> Lamy Safari Fountain Pen </strong></p>

<p>Back in April 2014 at Chef Conf, <a href="https://twitter.com/isafarnik">@isafarnik</a> let me borrow his Lamy Safari. It flowed, was a great width for me in my hand and wrote nicely in my moleskin.</p>

<p>I purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T401Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002T401Y&linkCode=as2&tag=sigjesspace-20&linkId=VD7GXIAUV7QRUYMT">Lamy Safari Charcoal Fountain Pen</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=sigjesspace-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0002T401Y" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (along with a second blue one) and it&rsquo;s been my go to pen since then.</p>

<p>I also have tried out different ink with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019W4EIW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0019W4EIW&linkCode=as2&tag=sigjesspace-20&linkId=VWI4SOYVWBXFKCGT">Lamy Safari Converter Z24</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=sigjesspace-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0019W4EIW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BZ28JDW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BZ28JDW&linkCode=as2&tag=sigjesspace-20&linkId=VBG3ZQMCTOPX2SXP">Lamy Refills by Monteverde Rainbow Fountain Pen Cartridge</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=sigjesspace-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00BZ28JDW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>

<p>In the converter cartridge, I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJAJQ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000WJAJQ4&linkCode=as2&tag=sigjesspace-20&linkId=3MYQARAGEZLVGZ5X">Noodlers Polar Blue Eternal Ink</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=sigjesspace-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000WJAJQ4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>

<p><strong>The good</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pen is a great width for my hand.</li>
<li>Ink flows easily.</li>
<li>My handwriting is improved just from feeling like I&rsquo;m writing with something substantial.</li>
<li>The Lamy ink and the Noodlers Polar Blue ink are great colors.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>The problems</strong>:</p>

<p><strong><em> The Ink </em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The ink can smear if touched right after, so if I pause or am writing too quickly &ndash; smudge.</li>
<li>The ink bleeds through on most papers. I received the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; notebook at a conference that did NOT which was amazing (yay for conference swag of good notebooks!). A notebook I got from a Google event has also been great. It works &ldquo;ok&rdquo; in moleskin notebooks.</li>
<li>The Monteverde Rainbow ink has some not great colors. I should have figured out what maps to what, but for example the red wasn&rsquo;t RED, and the color I&rsquo;m currently trying out is a murky brown.</li>
</ul>


<p>Due to the first problem, I tend to write a bit differently filling in the top of the back and front of facing pages and then filling in below.</p>

<p><strong><em> The Pen </em></strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really pay attention too much to the fact that I get ink all over me most of the time. I&rsquo;ve noticed this with most pens. I noticed that my blue Lamy was more messy than the black pen. After examining the nib closely I think that there might actually be a defect in the nib. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1uhn2t/really_bad_ink_creep_on_lamy_safari/">When I did some google searches</a> which led me to <a href="http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/ttp/creeps.htm">A case of the Creeps</a>. So it could be a mixmatch between the ink and the nib (which is why I purchased the different ink to try out). Essentially, I need to find a &ldquo;less wet&rdquo; ink to try out with the safari to see whether the experience changes.</p>

<p>In future posts, I&rsquo;ll take a look at the Unball JetStream, Bic Atlantis, PaperMate InkJoy, Uniball Signo 207, and Le Pens.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little over seven years ago I was starting a new job. At the time I was 3 years into a health journey and had a goal of doing 25 hikes in 1 year. In 2009, I hiked my longest single day hike of 14 miles across two parks.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3453/3393516147_e760d05d33_n.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Over time being the single point of failure at work meant that I was not able to spend weekends hiking. Somewhere along the way, job stress combined with appendicitis and complications from surgery led to a state of low energy, high pain and not a lot of positive fueling activities.</p>

<p>In 2014, I joined Chef. All of a sudden some of the barriers that were in place fell away. Admittedly some of these were self imposed based on my own (high) expectations of my work. I started physical therapy and celebrated being able to walk further month by month.</p>

<p>For the last 3 weeks I have been on vacation and taking advantage of it in part by getting back into hiking. Each year for the last few years I&rsquo;ve set a reading goal on Goodreads that I have accomplished, this year I&rsquo;m bringing back my hiking goals! Rather than setting a number of hikes, my goal is to be able to hike <strong>15 miles</strong> in a single day by December 2015.</p>

<p>Today George, Brian and myself went on our first hike of 2015 at <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=666">The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park</a> which is a few miles north of Aptos. It was relatively short as I&rsquo;m still sore from the last hike of 2014. Even though I&rsquo;ve lived in the Bay area for years, until this past December I&rsquo;ve never gone to this park. It&rsquo;s about an hour away from home and actually has a nicer area to walk with your dog than Henry Cowell. There are not great bathroom facilities here so not a great park for young families and long trips. The toilet at the trail head is enclosed in a small dark, dank building with the corpses of hundreds of flies on sticky paper hanging over your head. Paths are also not well marked. Lower areas allow dogs on leashes but past the &ldquo;Winter Gate&rdquo; dogs are only allowed on the fire road. Some of the trails cross the creek, and the expectation is to cross logs or rocks or wade.</p>

<p>Second growth redwoods line the road past the locked &ldquo;Winter Gate&rdquo;. There are also some eucalyptus trees. The creek burbles along to the side. Mary Easton Picnic area is very quiet with lots of picnic tables and another small dark less dank toilet stop.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t see most of the items on this <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/check_lists/6438-The-Forest-of-Nisene-Marks-State-Park-Check-List">checklist</a> but we did see Oyster mushrooms! Apparently there is a yearly <a href="http://ffsc.us/fair/2015/about">Fungus Fair</a> coming up next weekend where you can learn about the different fungi in the forest. We did see quite a bit of English Ivy which appears to be an invasive species.</p>

<p>Later this year we hope to hike up to the <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/666/files/TheForestNiseneMarksWebBroch2012.pdf">1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake epicenter</a>. This is in a no-dog area part of the park so it will have to be a no-dog hiking day.</p>

<p>Overall this was a great adventure. I can easily see us coming back multiple times as I build back my stamina. There are short and long hikes with a wide range of experiences. The Aptos Creek Fire Road between the Steel Bridge to the Mary Easton Picnic area is mostly flat with a small bit of elevation towards the end. Past this area there is a gate that marks where dogs aren&rsquo;t allowed (and they aren&rsquo;t allowed on the Porter Trail or the West Ridge Trail). The Terrace Trail, and Oak Ridge Trail both have a small bit of elevation. While our hike was short, there is so much more for us to do here including hiking all the way out to the Soquel Demonstration State forest.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad that my current job allows for me to even consider the idea of working towards this goal for myself. With the additional travel for clients and conferences there is potential for me to explore other areas as well. I am privileged to live in an area that continues to develop additional trails and parks to explore. I&rsquo;m looking forward to finding out about other places that have trails to explore. If you have recommendations for your favorite areas to hike please do share!</p>
