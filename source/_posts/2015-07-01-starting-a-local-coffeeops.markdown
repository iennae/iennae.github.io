A few years ago after a conference, a friend recommended I meet up with [Marius Dulcea](https://twitter.com/mariusducea) in the Bay area. We grabbed some coffee and with the discussion I felt energized. 

Part of the energy derived from Marius being awesome. Marius has been a key [DevOpsDays Silicon Valley](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/) organizer for years and community builder within the Chef and DevOps community. His insight into a variety of current and future technology was interesting and educational. 

Part of the energy derived from the mental engagement outside of the everyday. The value of this fellowship was expanding horizons to see beyond the walls of the technology and cultural mores of my then company. My role was in the middle of the company's "ladder of prestige" leading to a lot of pressure with little reward. I had been having problems seeing the value of the work I was doing or what impact it made.

Talking to Marius gave me insight about what I was working on. It helped me recognize that I needed a change and that it was critical for my mental health to connect with a larger community of practicitioners. 

All conferences have a informal hallway track that describes the conversations in conference corridors in between sessions and after hours. Conferences are only a few days in length so the relative benefit of the hallway track is minimal. Depending on costs of attendance and job flexibility, the hallway track may not be available to a majority of people in the industry. 

I envisioned creating a "hallway track" space with intra-company cooperation; affording individuals a place to meet together with no agenda, to connect, share in an undirected manner. 

I sent out a tweet with a location, time and #coffeeops and showed up. The first few times, only one or two folks would show up. As time passed more people joined and interesting discussions like [leveling up your skills](https://medium.com/bridging-the-gaps/leveling-up-your-skills-51169238e0d7) were had. Now, other folks have started up local coffeeops from [Seattle, Washington](http://www.meetup.com/Downtown-Seattle-Friday-Morning-CoffeeOps/) to Sydney, Australia. 

As a remote employee at [Chef](http://chef.io), it has become even more valuable to me as water cooler time; that time to take a break and take a breather.  

[Coffeeops](http://www.coffeeops.org/) is a way to generate your own hallway track, cross company cooperation and individual improvement.

How do you start up a CoffeeOps?

* Be patient, it takes time to catch hold. How much community do you already have? Are there people looking for the same kind of outlet? Is there already something filling the gap? What is the density of people in your area? Do you have the time and energy to expend if this is completely new in your area? 
* Talk about it. Ask for help. Use twitter and mailing lists. 
* Pick a good environment for talking.
* Have coffee and show up. More people will show up over time. (You can also drink tea or cocoa or have brunch!)
* Treat the meeting as work. Talk about it with your co-workers and your manager. 
* When starting out don't get too bogged down by formalities of rules and procedures. Code of Conduct is important. Any other aspect is open for discussion based on the group of people that come together. Some folks will make the decision to come based on an agenda. Others will be more likely to come if it's more freeform as they deal with other obligations before heading over.
