I purchased a set of 3 Uniball Jetstream RT 0.7 mm black ink in January of 2014. The first thing I noticed was the length of the pen was significantly shorter from the Safari that I've been using. It will take some time before I can tell whether this is actually a problem or just a difference. 

The ink definitely dries quickly. I can't see how someone could smudge this unless the paper was somewhat wet already.

On moleskin paper, it was more readily stuttering where ink seemed to stop.
