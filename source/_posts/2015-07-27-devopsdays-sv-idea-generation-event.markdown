**tl;dr CoffeeOps - DevOpsDays Idea Generation <br>
July 28, 2015 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM at [Crema Coffee Roasting Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/crema-coffee-roasting-co-san-jose) <br>
950 The Alameda, San Jose, California**<br>

As one of the DevOpsDays Silicon Valley (DODSV) organizers, I care about creating a diverse and inclusive event. As a whole, DevOpsDays organizers value the participation of each member of the DevOps community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. DODSV has a [Code of Conduct](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/conduct/) as used by previous DevOpsDays. 

[The DODSV CFP is open and we want to hear from you!](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/propose/) Your views and experiences in enterprise or startup, security, database design and administration, development, operations, community management and more have value in improving the ecosystem, informing others of how to build strong, resilient teams in a sustainable manner while getting work done. Bridget Kromhout, DevOpsDays core  and DOD Minneapolis organizer wrote about this to a greater depth in [The First Rule of DevOps Club](http://bridgetkromhout.com/blog/2014/11/03/the-first-rule-of-devops-club/). The CFP for [DevOpsDays Silicon Valley](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/propose/) is currently open until September 30. 

Taking off my "DevOpsDays SV" organizer hat, and putting on my "Community Builder" hat for a moment, to help encourage folks who have thought about speaking but are not sure about their ideas, and to provide a space for folks who aren't interested in speaking but want to participate in the process of building a great diverse and inclusive local conference, I've organized a special edition CoffeeOps event for DevOpsDays Idea generation at **[Crema Coffee Roasting Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/crema-coffee-roasting-co-san-jose) in San Jose on July 28, 2015 at 7pm.**

This event is open to anyone who is interested in brainstorming potential talk ideas, providing feedback about talk ideas, and connecting individuals who might want to work on ideas together.
