**tl;dr CoffeeOps - DevOpsDays Idea Generation
July 28, 2015 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM at Crema Coffee Roasting Company 
950 The Alameda, San Jose, CA 95126, United States**

[DevOpsDays Silicon Valley](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/) is coming up November 6 - 7, 2015. I'm one of the DevOpsDays Silicon Valley organizers. As with all DevOpsDays events we value diversity and inclusivity as we come together and share our stories. We value the participation of each member of the DevOps community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. DevOpsDays Silicon Valley has a [Code of Conduct](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/conduct/) as used by previous DevOpsDays. 

[We want to hear from you!](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/propose/) Your view and experiences in enterprise or startup, security, database design and administration, development, operations, community management and more have value in improving the ecosystem, informing others of how to build strong resilient teams in a sustainable manner while getting work done. The CFP for [DevOpsDays Silicon Valley](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-siliconvalley/propose/) is currently open until September 30. 

Taking off my "DevOpsDays SV" organizer hat, and putting on my "Community Builder" hat for a moment, to help encourage folks who have thought about speaking but are not sure about their ideas, and provide a space for folks who aren't interested in speaking but want to participate in the process of building a great local conference, I've organized a special edition CoffeeOps event for DevOpsDays Idea generation at **[Crema Coffee Roasting Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/crema-coffee-roasting-co-san-jose) in San Jose on July 28, 2015 at 7pm.**
